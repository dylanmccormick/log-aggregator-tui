# Log Aggregator TUI - Progress & Next Steps

## Current Status
✅ **Project Setup Complete**
- Basic Bubbletea structure in place (`cmd/main.go`)
- `logMessage` struct defined in `internal/log/parser.go`
- Dependencies installed (bubbletea, lipgloss)

✅ **Basic Parser Implementation**
- `ReadLogFile()` and `parseLog()` functions working
- Error handling improved for file operations
- Sample test data added to `testdata/sample.log`

✅ **Architecture Decisions Made**
- Using standard library for file reading with `bufio.Scanner`
- String splitting approach for log parsing (avoiding regex initially)
- Unit testing strategy with Go's built-in testing package

## Afternoon Session Tasks

### 1. Fix Parser Error Handling
Replace panic in `parseLog()` with proper error returns. Handle malformed timestamps gracefully.
- Return descriptive errors instead of panicking
- Test with malformed log lines to verify error handling

### 2. Write Comprehensive Unit Tests
Create `internal/log/parser_test.go` with table-driven tests covering normal and edge cases.
- Test valid log formats and timestamp parsing
- Test malformed lines, empty strings, and edge cases

### 3. Improve Log Parsing Robustness
Handle various log formats and edge cases like extra whitespace, missing components.
- Support logs with varying numbers of fields
- Gracefully handle empty lines and malformed entries

## Questions to Consider
- Should malformed lines be skipped or cause failure?
- What additional timestamp formats should be supported?
- How to handle logs without standard structure?

## Future Sessions
- Wire parsed logs into Bubbletea model
- Add basic display/scrolling in TUI
- Implement filtering and search functionality
- Add real-time file watching
